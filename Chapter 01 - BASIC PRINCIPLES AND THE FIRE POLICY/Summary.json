Subrogation</h3> <p>Upon claim settlement, the insurer gains the right to recover from third parties responsible for the loss.</p> <h3>5. Contribution</h3> <p>If multiple policies cover the same property, the insured can recover only the proportional loss from each policy.</p> <h2>C. Fire Tariff</h2> <h3>1. Overview</h3> <p>Fire insurance rates and rules were regulated by the All India Fire Tariff (AIFT) under the Insurance Act, 1938. Although the rating aspect was deregulated in 2007, other conditions like clauses and warranties remain binding.</p> <h3>2. Policy Structure</h3> <ul> <li><strong>Operative Clause:</strong> Covers direct loss from specified perils, including fire, lightning, and explosion.</li> <li><strong>General Exclusions:</strong> Excludes losses due to war, nuclear risks, pollution, theft, or earthquake unless endorsed.</li> <li><strong>General Conditions:</strong> Defines responsibilities, alterations, fraud prevention, and other procedural requirements.</li> </ul> <h2>D.

General Exclusions</h2> <ul> <li>Loss from war, nuclear risks, or pollution.</li> <li>Damage to specific items like manuscripts, currency, or artworks unless explicitly covered.</li> <li>Consequential losses (covered under separate policies).</li> </ul> <h2>F. Conditions of the Policy</h2> <h3>1. Fraud</h3> <p>Fraudulent claims void the policy.</p> <h3>2. Material Alterations</h3> <p>Insurance ceases for unreported changes that increase risk (e.g., trade alterations).</p> <h3>3. Pro Rata Average</h3> <p>Claims are proportionally reduced for under-insurance.</p> <h3>4. Marine Clause</h3> <p>Excludes losses already covered by marine policies, except for excess amounts.</p> <h3>5. Arbitration</h3> <p>Disputes over claim amounts are resolved through arbitration under the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996.</p> <h2>G. Claims Process</h2> <h3>1. Notification</h3> <p>The insured must notify the insurer immediately and provide a detailed claim statement within 15 days.</p> <h3>2.

Settlement</h3> <p>The insurer may:</p> <ul> <li>Pay the value of the property.</li> <li>Reinstate or replace the property.</li> <li>Apply pro-rata average if under-insured.</li> </ul> <h2>H. Additional Clauses</h2> <ul> <li><strong>Debris Removal Clause:</strong> Covers cleanup costs up to 1% of the claim amount.</li> <li><strong>Architects’ Fees Clause:</strong> Covers professional fees up to 3% of the claim.</li> <li><strong>Reinstatement Clause:</strong> Allows reconstruction within the insured sum.</li> </ul> <h2>Conclusion</h2> <p>Fire insurance is governed by principles ensuring fairness and indemnity. The policies and tariffs are structured to provide coverage against specific perils while excluding certain risks unless explicitly covered. Understanding these principles and conditions is crucial for both insurers and insured parties.</p>"
